    <ul>
      <li>Italian sausage</li>
      <li>Butter or oil</li>
      <li>Onion (yellow, red) | sliced</li>
      <li>Garlic | minced</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until brown on all
        sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from skillet, and slice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in the same skillet. Stir in onions and garlic, and cook 2
        to 3 minutes. Mix in bell peppers, season with basil and oregano, and
        stir in 1/4 cup wine. Continue to cook and stir until peppers and onions

      <li>
        Return sausage slices to the skillet. Reduce heat to low, cover, and
        simmer 15 minutes, or until sausage is heated through, adding more wine
        if needed.
