    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      There are all kinds of tasty add-ins to risotto, and mushrooms are just
      one of them. Mushrooms add an earthy, savory flavor to risotto that makes
      it a good complement to main dishes like roast chicken, pork, or beef. You
      can serve mushroom risotto as a side dish, a main dish, or a starter to a
      multi-course Italian menu.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken broth</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Mushrooms (portobello, white) | thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Shallots or onions | diced</li>
      <li>Arborio rice</li>
      <li>White wine</li>
      <li>Chives | finely chopped</li>
      <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Sea salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over
        medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir
        until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a
        bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook
        for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and
        pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in 1/2 cup wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed.
        Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is
        absorbed. Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly,
        until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the
        bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, chives,
        and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
